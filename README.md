This is my Flutter portfolio hosted on Netlify

Created using Flutter and Dart, my portfolio showcases my journey and experiences in the
tech industry. It is designed to be responsive, adapting seamlessly to both desktop and
mobile devices.

Unfortunately, the original source code is no longer available, so this project is no longer under active development.
